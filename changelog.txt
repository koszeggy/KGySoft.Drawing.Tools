    without changing the size (allowing any icon size).
  ! When an icon is debugged as an image, the raw format of its images is always displayed as Icon. Though when
    an icon is opened from file or is debugged as icon, Bmp/Png format is displayed for non-compound view.

+ KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.Test.exe
==============================================
+ Providing tests for all possible PixelFormats (applies Bitmap, BitmapData, Graphics, Palette)
+ Bitmap/Metafile/Icon types can be debugged as Image or as their self type (affects replacing while debugging)
+ Also BitmapData and Graphics can be opened directly
- If an image was debugged directly, then after replacing the image and closing the debugger the tester was crashed.
- A Metafile with WMF format was not be able to be opened by the debugger
