! v2.1.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe
==================================
+ API changes: New public types to be able to debug several types by referencing the KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools
  assembly:
  + New public types in KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools namespace:
    + InstallationManager class
  + New public types in KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.Model namespace:
    + ImageInfoBase class
    + ImageInfo class
    + ImageFrameInfo class
    + BitmapDataInfo class
    + GraphicsInfo class
    + InstallationInfo class
    + ImageInfoType enum
  + New public types in KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.ViewModel namespace:
    + IViewModel interface
    + IViewModel<TModel> interface
    + ViewModelFactory class
  + New public types in KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.View namespace:
    + IView interface
    + ViewFactory class
! Functional changes:
  ! When Icon type is being debugged and a non-icon image is opened, then the image will be converted to icon
    without changing the size (allowing any icon size).
  ! When an icon is debugged as an image, the raw format of its images is always displayed as Icon. Though when
    an icon is opened from file or is debugged as icon, Bmp/Png format is displayed for non-compound view.
  ! When debugging a Graphics instance not showing all those properties anymore, which are obvious also from the
    regular debug window.
  ! Improving quality, when image is saved in a format that does not support current pixel format. Though this is
    is an improvement the result might not be incompatible with earlier results.
  ! Installation Manager: When there are multiple detected VisualStudio versions the newest one is selected by
    default instead of the oldest one.
  + Supporting all possible PixelFormats
  + Always allowing to save in Icon format
  + Saving as TIFF allows to save a multi-page image even for animations and icons if compound view is selected.
  + Installation Manager: The installer now supports .NET Core 3.0+ projects
  - If an indexed bitmap was debugged, then changing a transparent palette entry did not always work properly.

+ KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.dll
=========================================
+ The DebuggerHelper class have been made public, which provides public access for some debugger visualizers.
- Serialization of a Metafile with WMF format failed in some cases.
- Debugging Bitmaps of rare PixelFormats failed, now all possible formats are supported.

+ KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.Test.exe
==============================================
+ Providing tests for all possible PixelFormats (applies Bitmap, BitmapData, Graphics, Palette)
+ Bitmap/Metafile/Icon types can be debugged as Image or as their self type (affects replacing while debugging)
+ Also BitmapData and Graphics can be opened directly
- If an image was debugged directly, then after replacing the image and closing the debugger the tester was crashed.
- A Metafile with WMF format was not be able to be opened by the debugger

! v2.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! Assembly names:
=================
! Instead of many separate KGySoft.DebuggerVisualizers.VS<version>.dll files from now on there is one
  KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.dll for each .NET frameworks.
! KGySoft.DebuggerVisualizers.Common.dll has been renamed to KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe, which
  is an executable file now.

! KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe
==================================
! As an executable file, it can be launched as a standalone application.
! In Windows XP icons will be converted to uncompressed ones.
+ New "Manage debugger visualizer installations" menu (gear icon) for installing the debugger
  visualizer to any Visual Studio version (requires the KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.dll)
+ Supporting high-resolution icons in Windows XP.
+ Multi page TIFF images can be saved all together and also separately.
+ High DPI displays are supported

+ KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.dll
=========================================
+ Compatible with all Visual Studio versions starting with Visual Studio 2008 (tested with versions from 2008 to 2019).

+ KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.Package.dll
=================================================
+ Installer for the visualizer as a VSIX Package (only for .NET 4.5, requires at least Visual Studio 2013)
