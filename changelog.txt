! Breaking change
* Compatible change
- Bugfix
+ New feature
===============================================================================

~~~~~~~~~
* v5.1.0:
~~~~~~~~~

+ KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.dll
=========================================
+ CustomBitmapSerializationInfoBase class:
  + New AsBitmapData method

- KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.SkiaSharp.dll
===================================================
- Fixing possible MissingMethodException when the debugged project references KGySoft.Drawing.Core as well, but with
  a different assembly identity.

- KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.Wpf.dll
=============================================
- Fixing possible MissingMethodException when the debugged project references KGySoft.Drawing.Core as well, but with
  a different assembly identity.


~~~~~~~~~
! v5.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.Package.x64.dll
=====================================================
! The debugger visualizers now support Visual Studio 2022 extension-based visualizers. They are displayed in a tool
  window instead of the classic dialogs. The tool window can remain open while stepping through the code, and can be
  docked in the Visual Studio IDE. If you prefer the classic dialog, download the 4.6.2 build and use the installer
  of the ImagingTools application.
! The extension requires Visual Studio 2022 version 17.9 Preview 1 or higher. To install the debugger visualizers
  for Visual Studio 2022 version 17.8 or lower, download the 4.6.2 build and use the installer of the ImagingTools
  application.
! The startup code now removes the old debugger visualizers from the Documents\Visual Studio 2022\Visualizers folder
  to avoid conflicts with the new extension-based visualizers. Though if you install them manually, they will be
  preserved if the version number is 5.0.0 or higher.


! KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe
==================================
! UI changes:

! Debugger Visualizer Installations dialog:
  ! In the .NET Core and .NET Framework 4.7.2+ builds the classic visualizers cannot be installed anymore.
  * Installing the classic debugger visualizer for Visual Studio 2022 or higher asks for confirmation because the
    extension-based visualizers from Visual Studio Marketplace are recommended.
! Language Settings dialog:
  ! It no longer has "Allow using resource files" option. Instead, the application automatically uses resource files
    if they are available.
  * The languages are now sorted by their native names instead of their English names.
* Using dark mode when the Windows theme is set to dark (when executing the application on Windows 10 or higher).
* The default font is adjusted to the current OS theme. For example, on Windows 11, the default font is Segoe UI
  rather than MS Sans Serif (affects .NET Framework builds).
* Fixing the tool strip overflow button scaling on high DPI displays (affects .NET Framework builds).
* Fixing the tool strip overflow button appearance in high contrast mode.
* Palette visualizer:
  * The dialog width does not have a maximum limit anymore. The entries are scaled to fit the available width.
+ Edit Resources window:
  + New 'Hide Dependent Resources' check box.
  + New 'Open in containing folder' button to open the folder of the selected resource.

! API changes:

! KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.ViewModel namespace:
---------------------------------------------------
! IViewModel<TModel> interface:
  ! New ChangesApplied event and TrySetModel method. Breaking change only if you implemented this interface,
    which is normally not needed.
! ViewModelFactory class:
  ! The return value of the FromPalette(ColorPalette, bool) method has been changed to IViewModel<ColorPalette> from
    IViewModel<Color[]>. The FromPalette(Color[], bool) overload still returns IViewModel<Color[]>.
  * The return type of the FromGraphics(GraphicsInfo) method has been changed to IViewModel<GraphicsInfo> from
    IViewModel. This is a compatible change because IVIewModel<TModel> is a more specific type than IViewModel.
  * The return type of the FromBitmapData(BitmapDataInfo) method has been changed to IViewModel<BitmapDataInfo> from
    IViewModel. This is a compatible change because IVIewModel<TModel> is a more specific type than IViewModel.
  * The return type of the FromCustomBitmap method has been changed to IViewModel<CustomBitmapInfo> from
    IViewModel. This is a compatible change because IVIewModel<TModel> is a more specific type than IViewModel.
  * The return type of the FromCustomColor method has been changed to IViewModel<CustomColorInfo> from
    IViewModel. This is a compatible change because IVIewModel<TModel> is a more specific type than IViewModel.
  * The return type of the FromCustomPalette method has been changed to IViewModel<CustomPaletteInfo> from
    IViewModel. This is a compatible change because IVIewModel<TModel> is a more specific type than IViewModel.

* KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.View namespace:
----------------------------------------------
* ViewFactory class:
  * Opening a view for an empty palette no longer closes the view immediately.

=====================================================
* Using info bars instead of message dialogs.


~~~~~~~~~
+ v3.1.0:
~~~~~~~~~

+ KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.SkiaSharp.dll
===================================================
+ A new debugger visualizer assembly to support SkiaSharp types.


~~~~~~~~~
! v3.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

* KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe
==================================
- Adjust Gamma: Adjusting the slider with the mouse not always worked.
- Supporting CMYK images
- Fixing language initialization from custom location

+ API changes:
  + KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.Model namespace:
    + New CustomBitmapInfo class
    + New CustomColorInfo class
    + New CustomPaletteInfo class
  + KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.ViewModel namespace:
    + ViewModelFactory class:
      + New FromPalette overload
      + New FromCustomBitmap method

~~~~~~~~~
* v2.6.0:
~~~~~~~~~

* KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe
==================================
+ Supporting saving animated GIF images even if frames have been changed. Saving icons or TIFF files as GIF while
  the compound mode is checked also saves an animated GIF file with 1 second delay for each frames.
- Opening a .bdat file in Bitmap visualizer mode triggered the "Metafile has been converted to Bitmap..." message.
- Could not open an animated GIF in Mono/Linux. Still existing known issue: libgdiplus decodes delta frames and
  different frame sizes incorrectly. This could only be solved by a custom decoder.

+ API changes:
  + ImageInfo class: New constructor overloads to be able to prevent cloning each frames.

- KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.dll
=========================================
- Debugging a Graphics instance did not always work from a .NET [Core] project.
- Fixing possible AcessViolationException when replacing a small debugged image to a huge one and debugging the
  replaced huge image again. In such case the Visual Studio debugger may dispose large objects even in the middle
  of a serialization session to prevent running out of memory. It also rendered the debugged object invalid.
- When serializing, not cloning each frame of multi-page images to prevent the Visual Studio debugger from disposing
  the debugged image.
- Fixing possible OutOfMemoryException from the debugger domain when a large debugged image has been replaced to
  a modified but unsaved image, in which case huge memory streams were transferred between application domains.
  From now on the debugger visualizer uses temp files if its domain has write access to the system TEMP folder.


~~~~~~~~~
* v2.5.0:
~~~~~~~~~

* KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe
==================================
* Language Settings
  + An absolute path can be set for the resources.
- .NET 5 build: Opening URLs from the help menu didn't work due to a breaking change introduced in .NET Core 3.1.

* API changes:
  * ViewModelFactory class: CreateEditResources has an optional hasPendingChanges parameter that allows applying
    changes without any editing.

+ KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.Package.x64.dll
=====================================================
+ This is a new installer for the 64-bit Visual Studio 2022


~~~~~~~~~
* v2.4.0:
~~~~~~~~~

* KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe
==================================
+ Targeting also .NET 5.0
+ Now panning a zoomed image is possible also by clicking and dragging with the mouse (besides usual scrolling).
+ Zooming is now possible also with keyboard shortcuts, the Auto Zoom button has now a drop-down part for the
  additional options.
+ Supporting localization from .resx files with editing, downloading and applying changes on-the-fly.
  Note: Right-to-left languages are also supported though with some limitations, especially under Mono.
  On Windows some validation tool tips are not aligned right but otherwise the layout is arranged correctly.
* Image visualizer form:
  + OK/Cancel buttons in debug mode when image is editable
  - Fixing several tool strip appearance issues, including high DPI and high contrast modes
* Palette visualizer form:
  + OK/Cancel buttons when palette is editable
  - Fixing the alpha pattern on Mono
+ Color visualizer form: OK/Cancel buttons then the color is editable
* Manual zooming is enabled even if Auto Zoom is on; this turns off Auto Zoom automatically.
* ImageViewer control:
  * Turning on/off smoothing of zoomed images affects also shrunk images (previously affected enlarged images only).
  * Improving performance of some image formats.
- Fixing scaling of menu item images under Linux/Mono when using high DPI
- Color Count: Result was not always shown (and progress bar was not removed) if the operation ended very quickly.
- Resize:
  - Preventing that invalid sizes replace current text to 0
  - Changing error provider associated controls so the layout is not messed up on Linux
- Manage Installations:
  - Remove was always enabled even it there was no installed version
- Fixing possible errors when closing forms while an async operation is still in progress.

* API changes:
  * Members are annotated for using C# 8.0 nullable references
  + InstallationManager class:
    + New ImagingToolsVersion property
  + ViewModelFactory class:
    + New CreateLanguageSettings method
    + New CreateEditResources method
    + New CreateDownloadResources method
  + IViewModel interface
    + New IsModified property
  * IViewModel<TModel> interface
    * The IsModified property is now inherited from IViewModel
  + IView interface:
    + New ShowDialog(IView) overload
  + ViewFactory class:
    + New ShowDialog(IViewModel, IView) overload
  + New LocalizableLibraries enum
  + New LocalizationInfo class

- KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.dll
=========================================
- Fixing a possible IndexOutOfRangeException when debugging an animated GIF.
- Fixing possible incorrect initially displayed size info when debugging a multi-resolution icon or bitmap.
* Improved performance and reduced memory consumption when serializing and deserializing debugged objects.

* KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.Package.dll
=================================================
* ImagingTools and Manage Installations executed from the Visual Studio Tools menu are executed on a new thread
  so the possible lagging of Visual Studio does not affect the performance anymore.


~~~~~~~~~
+ v2.3.0:
~~~~~~~~~

+ KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe
==================================

    + New CreateAdjustColorSpace method
    + New CreateCountColors method
    + New CreateAdjustBrightness method
    + New CreateAdjustContrast method
    + New CreateAdjustGamma method


~~~~~~~~~
* v2.2.1:
~~~~~~~~~

* KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe
==================================
- Tolerating if uncompressed icon stream does not have a transparency mask.
* InstallationManager class:
  * To avoid confusion the Install method installs the .NET Core support only for the .NET 4.5 build. This is
    considered as a compatible change as .NET Core support didn't work for other builds anyway so only the error
    message will be different (and more reasonable) if we try to debug a Core project with the wrong installation.


~~~~~~~~~
* v2.2.0:
~~~~~~~~~

+ KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe
==================================
+ Targeting also .NET Core 3.0
- The Framework builds now support Mono (tested on Ubuntu Linux)
+ The image preview now can be zoomed and scrolled freely when Auto Zoom is turned off.
  To zoom use the Ctrl + Mouse Wheel or the pinch zooming gesture on the touchpad.
  For scrolling vertical and horizontal mouse wheels and the touchpad scrolling gestures are completely supported.
+ New Smooth Zooming toggle button:
  For bitmaps and icons toggles pixelated/smoothed appearance when the image is enlarged.
  For metafiles toggles anti-aliasing on any size. Can be ignored on low memory when zooming is too large
+ API changes:
  + InstallationInfo class: New TargetFramework property (not used in the .NET Framework 3.5 version)

- KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.dll
=========================================
- Changing ColorPalette serialization so now it works also when debugging .NET Core projects.

- KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.Test.exe
==============================================
- Fixing issues on Mono/Linux


~~~~~~~~~
! v2.1.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe
==================================
+ API changes: New public types to be able to debug several types by referencing the KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools
  assembly:
  + New public types in KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools namespace:
    + InstallationManager class
  + New public types in KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.Model namespace:
    + ImageInfoBase class
    + ImageInfo class
    + ImageFrameInfo class
    + BitmapDataInfo class
    + GraphicsInfo class
    + InstallationInfo class
    + ImageInfoType enum
  + New public types in KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.ViewModel namespace:
    + IViewModel interface
    + IViewModel<TModel> interface
    + ViewModelFactory class
  + New public types in KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.View namespace:
    + IView interface
    + ViewFactory class
! Functional changes:
  ! When Icon type is being debugged and a non-icon image is opened, then the image will be converted to icon
    without changing the size (allowing any icon size).
  ! When an icon is debugged as an image, the raw format of its images is always displayed as Icon. Though when
    an icon is opened from file or is debugged as icon, Bmp/Png format is displayed for non-compound view.
  ! When debugging a Graphics instance not showing all those properties anymore, which are obvious also from the
    regular debug window.
  ! Improving quality, when image is saved in a format that does not support current pixel format. Though this is
    is an improvement the result might not be incompatible with earlier results.
  ! Installation Manager: When there are multiple detected VisualStudio versions the newest one is selected by
    default instead of the oldest one.
  + Supporting all possible PixelFormats
  + Always allowing to save in Icon format
  + Saving as TIFF allows to save a multi-page image even for animations and icons if compound view is selected.
  + Installation Manager: The installer now supports .NET Core 2.1+ projects
  - If an indexed bitmap was debugged, then changing a transparent palette entry did not always work properly.

+ KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.dll
=========================================
+ The DebuggerHelper class have been made public, which provides public access for some debugger visualizers.
- Serialization of a Metafile with WMF format failed in some cases.
- Debugging Bitmaps of rare PixelFormats failed, now all possible formats are supported.

+ KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.Test.exe
==============================================
+ Providing tests for all possible PixelFormats (applies Bitmap, BitmapData, Graphics, Palette)
+ Bitmap/Metafile/Icon types can be debugged as Image or as their self type (affects replacing while debugging)
+ Also BitmapData and Graphics can be opened directly
- If an image was debugged directly, then after replacing the image and closing the debugger the tester was crashed.
- A Metafile with WMF format was not be able to be opened by the debugger


~~~~~~~~~
! v2.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! Assembly names:
=================
! Instead of many separate KGySoft.DebuggerVisualizers.VS<version>.dll files from now on there is one
  KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.dll for each .NET frameworks.
! KGySoft.DebuggerVisualizers.Common.dll has been renamed to KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe, which
  is an executable file now.

! KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe
==================================
! As an executable file, it can be launched as a standalone application.
! In Windows XP icons will be converted to uncompressed ones.
+ New "Manage debugger visualizer installations" menu (gear icon) for installing the debugger
  visualizer to any Visual Studio version (requires the KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.dll)
+ Supporting high-resolution icons in Windows XP.
+ Multi page TIFF images can be saved all together and also separately.
+ High DPI displays are supported

+ KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.dll
=========================================
+ Compatible with all Visual Studio versions starting with Visual Studio 2008 (tested with versions from 2008 to 2019).

+ KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.Package.dll
=================================================
+ Installer for the visualizer as a VSIX Package (only for .NET 4.5, requires at least Visual Studio 2013)
