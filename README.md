# KGy SOFT Drawing Tools

The KGy SOFT Drawing Tools repository contains a couple of applications and some [Debugger Visualizers](#debugger-visualizers) for several GDI+, WPF and SkiaSharp types such as `Bitmap`, `Metafile`, `Icon`, `BitmapData`, `Graphics`, `ImageSource`, `SKBitmap`, etc. (see also below). The visualizers use [KGy SOFT Imaging Tools](#kgy-soft-imaging-tools) to display these types visually, which can be executed as a standalone application as well.

</p>

The Imaging Tools application makes possible to load images and icons from file, manipulate and save them into various formats. Several modifications are possible such as rotating, resizing, changing pixel format with quantizing and dithering, adjusting brightness, contrast and gamma, or even editing the palette entries of indexed bitmaps.

  <br/><em>Changing Pixel Format with Quantizing and Dithering</em>
</p>

> üí° _Tip:_ As a developer, you can access all of these image manipulaion functions by using [KGy SOFT Drawing Libraries](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing). It supports not just `System.Drawing` types but also completely managed and technology agnostic bitmap data manipulation as well.

### Compatibility

KGy SOFT Imaging Tools supports a wide range of platforms. Windows is supported starting with Windows XP but by using [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/) you can execute it also on Linux. See the [downloads](#download) for details.

<p align="center">

### Localization

KGy SOFT Imaging Tools supports localization from .resx files. New language resources can be generated for any languages, and you can edit the texts within the application. The changes can be applied on-the-fly, without exiting the application. If you switch to a right-to-left language, then the layout is also immediately applied (at least on Windows).

> üí° _Tip:_ As a developer, you can use [KGy SOFT Core Libraries](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.CoreLibraries#dynamic-resource-management) if you want something similar in your application.

The edited resources are saved in .resx files in the `Resources` subfolder of the application. Resources can be downloaded from within the application as well.

If you use Imaging Tools as debugger visualizers, then it can be executed from various locations. See the bottom of the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

## Debugger Visualizers

Imaging Tools is packed with several debugger visualizers for Visual Studio (compatible with all versions starting with Visual Studio 2008, and supports even .NET Core 2.1 and newer platform targets). When a type is debugged in Visual Studio and there is a debugger visualizer installed for that type, then a magnifier icon appears that you can click to open the visualizer.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Debugger Visualizer Usage" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27336165/124266849-c7ff1780-db37-11eb-9df8-f2149430da16.png"/>
  <br/><em>Debugger Visualizer Usage</em>
</p>

Either click the magnifier icon or choose a debugger visualizer from the drop down list (if more visualizers are applicable).

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Debugging a Graphics instance" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27336165/124266974-f54bc580-db37-11eb-98e1-207c48590afa.png"/>
  <br/><em>Debugging a Graphics instance</em>
</p>

 The debugger visualizers are invoked from different assemblies:
- The `KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.GdiPlus` assembly supports the following types:
  - `System.Drawing.Image`: If executed for a non read-only variable or member of type `Image`, then the actual value can be replaced by any `Bitmap` or `Metafile`.
   - `System.Drawing.Bitmap`: Supports multi-page, multi-resolution and animated `Bitmap` instances. The bitmap can be saved in many formats. In a non read-only context the bitmap can be replaced from file and its palette (for indexed bitmaps) can be edited.
   - `System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile`: Unlike many other image debugger visualizers, this one does not transform the metafile into a low-resolution PNG image because it is able to serialize the actual metafile content. The metafile can be saved into EMF/WMF formats. In a non read-only context the image can be replaced from file.
   - `System.Drawing.Icon`: Supports compound and huge icons even in Windows XP. The icon can be saved, and in a non read-only context it can be replaced from file.
   - `System.Drawing.Imaging.BitmapData`: Even for indexed data; however, the palette information cannot be retrieved.
   - `System.Drawing.Graphics`: Supports both image and native window graphics.
   - `System.Drawing.Imaging.ColorPalette`: In a non read-only context the colors can be edited.
   - `System.Drawing.Color`: In a non read-only context the color can be replaced.
- The `KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.Wpf` assembly supports the following types (in read-only mode):
   - `System.Windows.Media.ImageSource`: All derived types are supported, including vector images (`System.Windows.Media.DrawingImage`) and bitmaps (types derived from `System.Windows.Media.Imaging.BitmapSource` such as `BitmapFrame`, `BitmapFrame`, `WriteableBitmap`, etc.). Vector images are displayed as bitmaps, adjusted to the size of the primary display.
   - `System.Windows.Media.Imaging.BitmapPalette`: Color entries can be examined individually.
   - `System.Windows.Media.Color`: sRGB, ScRGB, and colors with context profile are all supported.
- The `KGySoft.Drawing.DebuggerVisualizers.SkiaSharp` assembly supports the following types (in read-only mode):
   - `SkiaSharp.SKBitmap`: All color/alpha types of any color space are supported
   - `SkiaSharp.SKImage`
   - `SkiaSharp.SKPixmap`
   - `SkiaSharp.SKSurface`: All back-ends are supported
   - `SkiaSharp.SKColor`

### Installing Debugger Visualizers

#### By VSIX Installer

If you use Visual Studio 2013 or newer, then you can perform the install directly from Visual Studio by the _Extensions/Manage Extensions_ (older Visual Studio versions: _Tools/Extensions and Updates..._) menu if you search for the "_KGy SOFT Image DebuggerVisualizers_" extension.

Alternatively, you can download the installer package from the VisualStudio Marketplace. There are two versions available:
* A [32-bit version](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KGySoft.drawing-debugger-visualizers) for Visual Studio 2013-2019
* And a [64-bit version](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KGySoft.drawing-debugger-visualizers-x64) for Visual Studio 2022

#### Manual Install

1. [Download](#download) the binaries and extract the .7z archive to any folder.
2. Open the folder with the extracted content. You will find five folders there:
  - `net35` contains the .NET Framework 3.5 build. Compatible with all Visual Studio versions starting with Visual Studio 2008 (tested with versions 2008-2019). Cannot be used to debug .NET Core applications. 
  - `net40` contains the .NET Framework 4.0 build. It requires at least Visual Studio 2010 but it's compatible even with Windows XP and ReactOS. Cannot be used to debug .NET Core applications.
  - `net45` contains the .NET Framework 4.5 build. It requires at least Windows Vista SP2 and Visual Studio 2012. With some limitations supports also .NET Core/.NET projects (in case of issues see the [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) section).
  - `net462` contains the .NET Framework 4.6.2 build. It requires at least Windows 7 SP1 and Visual Studio 2012. It contains also the SkiaSharp debugger visualizers, which is not included into the other builds. With some limitations supports also .NET Core/.NET projects (in case of issues see the [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) section).
  - `net6.0-windows` contains the .NET 6.0 binaries of the Imaging Tools application. Debugger visualizers are not included because it would not be recognized by Visual Studio anyway.
3. Execute `KGySoft.Drawing.ImagingTools.exe` from one of the folders listed above. Click the _Manage Debugger Visualizer Installations..._ button (the gear icon) on the toolbar.

  <br/><em>Installing Debugger Visualizers from Imaging Tools</em>
</p>

> üìù _Note:_ Starting with version 2.1.0 the debugger visualizers can be used also for .NET Core projects from Visual Studio 2019, even though no .NET Core binaries are used.

4. In the drop down list you will see the identified Visual Studio versions in your Documents folder. You can select either one of them or the _&lt;Custom Path...&gt;_ menu item to install the visualizer debuggers into a custom folder.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Selecting Visual Studio Version" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27336165/124272120-9dfd2380-db3e-11eb-896d-c244fdbd85bc.png"/>
  <br/><em>Selecting Visual Studio Version</em>
</p>

5. Click on the _Install_ button. On success the status will display the installed version.

## Download

> üí° _Tip:_ See [above](#by-vsix-installer) how to download the debugger visualizer installers

You can download the sources and the binaries as .7z/.zip archives at the [releases](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing.Tools/releases) page.

To support the widest possible range of platforms the binaries archive contains multiple builds in different folders.
* `net35`: This contains the .NET Framework 3.5 build and though it works on every platforms Imaging Tools supports, it is not really recommended to use as a standalone application. If you use Imaging Tools as [debugger visualizers](#installing-debugger-visualizers), then it is the only version you can use for Visual Studio 2008. For newer Visual Studio versions use it only if you want to debug a .NET Framework 2.0-3.5 application.
* `net40`: This is the .NET Framework 4.0 build. As a standalone application, it's basically recommended for Windows XP and ReactOS only.
* `net45`: This is the .NET Framework 4.5 build. Requires Windows Vista or later. As a debugger visualizer works both for .NET Framework 4.x and .NET Core projects (including .NET 5 and newer platforms) but does not support debugging SkiaSharp types.
* `net462`: This is the .NET Framework 4.6.2 build. Requires Windows 7 or greater, and this is the recommended version to use as a debugger visualizer for .NET Framework 4.x and .NET Core projects (including .NET 5 and newer platforms). As a standalone application, this is also the recommended version for Linux (requires Mono).
* `net6.0-windows`: This folder contains the .NET 6.0 build. As a standalone application this is the recommended version for Windows 7 and above. On the other hand, this one cannot be used as a debugger visualizer (even for .NET or .NET Core projects) and does not support Linux either.
